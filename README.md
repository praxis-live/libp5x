# libP5X

libP5X is a modular fork of the [Processing 4](https://processing.org/) core
library, as well as an alternative OpenGL renderer based on
[LWJGL](https://www.lwjgl.org/). Changes to the core are minimal to support the
requirements of the alternative renderer, as well as improve usage as a standalone
library. libP5X is used to support the Processing related features inside
[PraxisLIVE](https://www.praxislive.org) but made available as a separate library
for use in other projects.

libP5X is licensed under LGPL v2.1, the same as the upstream Processing 4 core
library.
